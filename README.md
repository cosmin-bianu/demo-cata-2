# Lazy Evaluation and Caching

This mini-project features a Java class where I highlight the benefits behind using lazy evaluation, which turns a blind eye on the review of an expression until it is necessary. 
Caching is a process for storing regularly used information in memory so it can be quickly accessed instead of being generated by the program every time it is requested.
